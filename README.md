# hack_client_upgrade

As a Chef, I would like to go through the process of upgrading the chef-client on a Windows node so that I can be more informed when discussing this process with customers.

## Issue/Description:
I'm pretty new to Chef in Windows, however I have a lot of customers who are using Windows and have questions I don't have specific answers to. One in particular is how the Chef run should behave during an upgrade of a Windows Chef client, and what is considered normal behavior vs. abnormal. I have gone through customer-facing documentation and have found there is no examples of what the behavior should look like.

Links:
https://learn.chef.io/modules/upgrade-chef-client#/
Actions:
Go through the Learn Chef documentation here using a Windows node as the target to upgrade.
Notate any issues you run into that should be documented in a new Guru card, along with any other helpful information you can share with fellow Chefs.
Share your findings with the Learn Chef folks if warranted to make sure feedback is fed back into the content.

Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Go through the Learn Chef Rally "Chef Client Upgrade" track using a Windows node
- [ ] Notate finding/issues/gotchas in a new Guru card to share with fellow Chefs
- [ ] Share findings with the Learn Chef Rally team if warranted, if not check off anyways
- [ ] Demo!
